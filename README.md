# remote-container-templates

Some branches with some basic .devcontainer configs (for vscode and vscode-insiders, and probably theia)


## Prerequisites / getting started

Have the remote containers plugin installed and docker as described [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). (Most important: have Docker installed and the ubuntu snap package for docker is not supported).

After that, a .devcontainer will be picked up when vscode opens a project, and you will be prompted to open your project in a remote container.
